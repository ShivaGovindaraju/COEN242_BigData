Assignment 2: MapReduce/Hive Top K Words

Team 21: Shiva K Govindaraju
Date: 17 May 2020

---MAPREDUCE EXECUTION---

Note: Ensure that mrjob is installed via pip.

MapReduce can be run either locally or on the Hadoop cluster.
It also requires different inputs to the command line depending
on which part of the assignment is being tested: the standard
top 100 words, or the top 100 for only words with more than 6
characters in them. The commands to be given are as follows:

Please fill in/output filenames in the locations shown (don't include the brackets).

To Run Locally - Normal Top 100 Words
>>>python3 word_count.py {INPUTFILENAME} | python3 tkw_top100.py > {OUTPUTFILENAME}

To Run Locally - Top 100 Words > 6 characters
>>>python3 word_count.py {INPUTFILENAME} | python3 tkw_sevenplus.py > {OUTPUTFILENAME}

To Run on Hadoop - Normal Top 100 Words
>>>python3 word_count.py -r hadoop {INPUTFILENAME} | python3 tkw_top100.py > {OUTPUTFILENAME}

To Run on Hadoop - Top 100 words > 6 characters
>>>python3 word_count.py -r hadoop {INPUTFILENAME} | python4 tkw_sevenplus.py > {OUTPUTFILENAME}

Note: proper execution might require the inclusion of a configuration file. See the full report for
more about mrjob.conf as it must be added and configured for your own system to run properly on the
hadoop cluster.

---HIVE EXECTUION---

Apache Hive's HQL scripts can only be run on the Hadoop cluster.
My script will run both the normal top 100 words and the top 100
words for > 6 characters. It requires the existence of two
directories in the local folder where the script is being run, both
with read-write permissions allowed for groups and users (use chmod 
to achieve this). These directories must be named '/hive_output_tkw'
and '/hive_output_tkw_sevenplus'.

Please fill the input filename in the location shown (don't include the brackets).

>>>hive -f tkw_HIVE.hql --hivevar inputfilename={INPUTFILENAME}

The output for the normal top 100 words will be found in the only file in
/hive_output_tkw. The top 100 words with lengths > 6 chars will be found
in /hive_output_tkw_sevenplus.

Warning: each time tkw_HIVE.hql is run, the contents of those directories
will be overwritten with the new outputs, so you cannot run this script
successively and assume that all output will be saved to different files.
After each time you run this script, you will need to copy the output data
to another directory in order for it to survive the next run of the script.
